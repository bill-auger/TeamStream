TeamStream clients and server (http://teamstream.heroku.com/)
-------------------------------------------------------------

TeamStream allows musicians to play music together over the internet
and is based on the excellent NINJAM softwares (http://ninjam.com/).
TeamStream is fully compatible with NINJAM servers when in NINJAM mode.
TeamStream mode is currently disabled while on public NINJAM servers 
though this may change in the future. For now, in order to fully utilize
all TeamStream related capabilities, you must install your own NINJAM server.
Visit the TeamStream HomePage (http://teamstream.heroku.com/) for details
or to download pre-compiled binaries.


Features:
Includes all the standard NINJAM features (sans the integrated FX)
Fully compatible with all known public NINJAM rooms
Redesigned sleeker GUI - view all jammers without scrolling on most screens

Creating desktop shortcut for favorite jam rooms
Quick login buttons for saving favorite jam rooms

    server/         NINJAM Server

How to build the Windows client with Visual Studio
--------------------------------------------------

  * Download and install the DirectX SDK (June 2010 release works well)
  * Copy dsound.h from the DirectX SDK to sdks/dxsdk/include/
  * Copy dsound.lib from the DirectX SDK to sdks/dxsdk/lib/x86/
  * Launch winclient.sln then open the project properties dialog and browse to
      Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General and add
	  ../../sdks/dxsdk/lib/x86/ to Additional Library Directories
  * Copy the Ogg/Vorbis SDK into sdks/ (e.g. sdks/oggvorbis-win32sdk-1.0.1/)
  * Lastly, stdint.h is included with VS2010 but not VS2008, so if you prefer to use
      VS2008 rather than converting a second time to VS2010, you will need to put
      a copy of it in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include
  * Hit F7 and watch the deprecation warnings fly :) then you're ready to jam


NINJAM fork information
------------------------

TeamStream began its life as a fork of the Wahjam project (http://wahjam.org/)
which itself is a fork of the original NINJAM software (http://www.ninjam.com/).
The original software is available at the respective websites and also mirrored
in this repo in the Downloads section.

The original source trees were taken from http://www.ninjam.com/. As of May 2012,
the server is unmodified from the original version and the curses client
is unmodified from the Wahjam version. The original files were:

  cclient_src_v0.01a.tar.gz
  ninjam_server_0.06.tar.gz
  ninjam_winclient_0.06.zip
