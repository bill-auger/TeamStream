How to build the Windows client with Visual Studio
--------------------------------------------------

  * Download and install the DirectX SDK (June 2010 release works well)
  * Copy dsound.h from the DirectX SDK to sdks/dxsdk/include/
  * Copy dsound.lib from the DirectX SDK to sdks/dxsdk/lib/x86/
  * Launch winclient.sln then open the project properties dialog and browse to
      Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General and add
	  ../../sdks/dxsdk/lib/x86/ to Additional Library Directories
  * Copy the Ogg/Vorbis SDK into sdks/ (e.g. sdks/oggvorbis-win32sdk-1.0.1/)
  * Lastly, stdint.h is included with VS2010 but not VS2008, so if you prefer to use
      VS2008 rather than converting a second time to VS2010, you will need to put
      a copy of it in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include
  * Hit F7 and watch the deprecation warnings fly :) then you're ready to jam


NINJAM fork information
------------------------

TeamStream began its life as a fork of the Wahjam project (http://wahjam.org/)
which itself is a fork of the original NINJAM software (http://www.ninjam.com/).
The original softwares are available at the respective websites and also mirrored
in this repo in the Downloads section.

The original source trees were taken from http://www.ninjam.com/. The most notable
modification to the Windows client from the Wahjam fork is the removal of the
proprietary integrated effects processor for which no documentation nor source code
was available. As of May 2012, the server is unmodified from the original version
and the curses client is unmodified from the Wahjam version. The original files were:

cclient_src_v0.01a.tar.gz
  https://github.com/downloads/mr-jonze/TeamStream/cclient_src_v0.01a.tar.gz
ninjam_server_0.06.tar.gz
